            <p>Abilities are special characteristics which make a character unique and help them survive the outbreak. During character creation, characters may purchase tiers in abilities based on their Attribute scores. Ability tiers are cumulative, meaning a character who has Tier 2 in an ability also has all the benefits of Tier 1, and a character who has Tier 3 in an ability has all the benefits of both Tiers 1 and 2.</p>
            <h2 id="purchasing">Purchasing Abilities</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>While creating a character, players have a number of ability points they may spend for each of their attribute scores. A Body score of 3 gives the player three points which may be spent to purchase (Body) abilities. If an ability relates to multiple attributes, players may spend their ability points from any of those attributes and must record which attribute the ability is associated with. Each point spent on that ability must come from the same attribute. For example, a player purchasing Billy Goat (Body, Spirit) may spend either Body or Spirit points. If they purchase the ability using Body they record the ability on their character sheet as Billy Goat (Body), while if they purchase the ability using Spirit it is instead recorded as Billy Goat (Spirit).</p>

            <p><i>You have a stomach of steel. You can keep down foods that would make anyone else sick.</i></p>
                <p>Tier 1: You spend no Survival when making a Constitution(Sustenance) save throw.</p>
                <p>Tier 2: Roll an additional 游릴 per 游릭 generated. These 游릴 cannot generate 游댮.</p>
                <p>Tier 3: +3游릴.</p>
                <hr />
            <h3>Culinary Arts</h3>
            <p>Tier 1: If at least one 游릭 is generated by Crafting(Cooking), generate an additional 游릭.</p>
            <p>Tier 2: After Cooking a meal, make a Morale roll. For every 6 rolled, each character who eats the meal recovers 1游눡.</p>
            <p>Tier 3: After Cooking a meal, characters who take a short rest immediately after eating the meal gain the benefits of a long rest instead.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3 id="poisonous-skin">Poisonous Skin (Body)</h3>
            <p>Whenever a character comes into direct contact with your skin, that character must make a Constitution save throw. You may choose a number of 游릴 up to the Dice value and subtract the Potency value from their result (游눡 or 丘멆잺 may be spent to force success as normal). If the save throw fails, the character becomes poisoned if they aren't already and they gain a number of poison points equal to the Poison value.</p>
            <p>At the end of a poisoned character's turn, you roll 1d6 for each poison point that character has. For every 6 rolled, that character suffers 1游린 poison. Then that character's poison points are reduced by half, rounding up.</p>

            <h3 id="rage">Rage (Body)</h3>
            <p>On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add 1游릴 to Athletics checks and Athletics save throws. </li>
                    <li>If at least 1游릭 is generated during an Athletics(Melee) attack, add a number of 游릱 to your dice pool equal to the Mastery value of the Rage tier table. </li>
                    <li>You gain defense against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage according to the Defense value of the Rage tier table.</li>
                </ul> 
            </p>
            <p>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>
            <p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if you turn ends and you haven't attacked an enemy since your last turn. You may also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>
            <p>Once you have raged a number of times equal to the Uses value of the Rage tier table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>
