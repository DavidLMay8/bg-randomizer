    <hr />
    <p>Whenever a survivor attempts an action with the possibility of failure, they must perform a skill check for that action. Skill checks are resolved by determining the skill used to perform the action, building a dice pool, rolling the check, and resolving results.</p>

    <p>The Skill Matrix is a collection of skills which correspond to attributes a character posseses. Attributes are given a score to define a character's ability when performing actions which utilize a given skill. The higher the score, the better a character is at utilizing that skill.</p>
    <h2 id="skill-checks">Performing Skill Checks</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3 id="skill-roles">Skill Checks Compared to Attribute and Skill Rolls</h3>
    <p>Not every roll of the dice counts as a skill check. A skill check always generates 🟢 and 🔴 to determine a survivor’s ability to accomplish some feat. Conversely, an attribute or skill roll sums up the total value of all rolled dice to determine some effect. A skill check is always written as “Skill(Action) check” while a roll is written as either “Attribute roll” or “Skill roll.” Building the dice pool (see <a href="#build-pool">Build Dice Pool</a>) for an attribute or skill roll is similar to building one for a skill check. It’s important to note that an attribute roll dice pool is built only using the dice for a single attribute. For example, a survivor with 3 Grit would roll three dice when instructed to make a Grit roll. If the same survivor has 2 Athletics, they would roll five dice when making a Prowess roll. Use 🟩 when making an attribute or skill roll.</p>
    <p>After making an attribute or skill roll, sum the total value of all dice rolled. This value is then used to resolve the effect which required the roll to be made. The initiative roll is a Prowess roll which all acting survivors must perform when starting combat. Each survivor who rolled for initiative then records the sum of all the dice they rolled, which is then referenced to determine initiative order during that combat encounter. Attribute and skill rolls never generate 🟢, 🔴, or ⚠️ unless specified by the effect requiring the roll.</p>
    <h3 id="determine-skill">Determine Skill to Use</h3>
    <p>The survivor will consult their Skill Matrix to determine which skill they will use for their action. A skill may cover a wide range of actions, while bonuses may only apply to a specific action. Checks are written in the style of Skill(Action) where Skill is the skill as found in the Skill Matrix and (Action) is the specific action or action type as it corresponds to the skill. See Actions on page XX for a glossary of common actions. If a player wishes to perform an action which is not found in the glossary, the GM determines which skill the action corresponds to.</p>
    <p><i>Nicole is preparing a much-needed meal for herself and her companions after a tough day of scavenging for supplies. Cooking is not a skill which appears on the Skill Matrix, but is an action which falls under the skill of Crafting. To prepare her meal, Nicole will make a Crafting(Cook) check.</i></p>
    <h3 id="build-pool">Build Dice Pool</h3>
    <p>Once the survivor has chosen the skill they will use for their check to attempt an action, they will build the dice pool used for the check. Each skill in the Skill Matrix has a corresponding Attribute and Proficiency. Attributes and Proficiencies are given a score during survivor creation. The first step in building the dice pool is to take a number of 🟩 equal to the skill’s corresponding Attribute plus Proficiency.</p>
    <p><i>Crafting(Cook) corresponds to the Brains Attribute and the Survival Proficiency. When she created her survivor, Nicole gave a 2 to Brains and a 3 to Survival. She will begin building her dice pool to attempt a Cooking check by taking 2🟩 for her Brains score and 3🟩 for her Survival score.</i></p>
    <p>After taking the initial 🟩 based on the chosen skill, the survivor will then add to their dice pool any 🟩 given by abilities and gear. Any other survivor may wish to assist the performing survivor in undertaking the action. If at least one survivor assists, add 🟩 to the dice pool.</p>
    <p>Any 🟩 which would be added to the dice pool beyond the sixth is converted to 🟦 (mastery dice) instead. Each 🟦 which rolls a 1 may be rerolled once. The new results must be kept, even if another 1 is rolled.</p>
    <p>The GM may then the check’s difficulty by spending ⚠️to add ⬛️ to the dice pool. Additional ⬛️ may be added due to negative conditions the survivor suffers from or by cumbersome gear they have equipped.</p>
    <p><i>Nicole always keeps her trusty Cookware kit nearby as the culinary arts have helped her maintain her humanity during the apocalypse. Her gear gives her +1🟩 to any Crafting(Cooking) action. However, she is not cooking in a nice kitchen, but is instead trying to prepare a meal among abandoned cars on a deserted highway. The GM decides to spend 2⚠️ to add 2⬛️ to the check. It’s tough trying to cook a delectable meal on a hard asphalt road! Nicole takes her initial 5🟩, adds 🟩 from her kit, and adds the 2⬛️ paid for by the GM.</i></p>
    <h3 id="resolve-action">Resolve Action</h3>
    <p>After the dice have been rolled, results are checked and the action is resolved. Each 6 provides a 🟢, while each 1 provides a 🔴. All other values are disregarded, except when taking 💢 to force a success (see <a href="#forcing-successes">Forcing Successes</a>) If the number of 🟢 is equal to or greater than 🔴, the skill check is a success. If there are more 🔴 than 🟢, the skill check is a failure. To resolve a failed check, the survivor must resolve each 🔴 narratively by describing the poor outcome of their action. The GM has the final say on whether the survivor has adequately played out their failure enough to resolve all of their 🔴. Alternatively, the survivor may resolve any number of their 🔴 narratively, to a minimum of 1 🔴, and give the rest to the GM as ⚠️. To resolve a successful check, the survivor must resolve each 🟢 narratively by describing the positive outcome of their action. Again, the GM has the final say on whether all of the 🟢 have been resolved properly. The GM may overrule if the resolution of any 🟢 would be too unrealistic. Any unspent 🟢 is given to the survivor as 🔶.</p>
    <p>Even though a skill check may succeed, the apocalypse is still cruel and unyielding. Any 1s rolled during a successful check are given to the GM as ⚠️. In the case where increased difficulty adds any ⬛️ to the dice pool, a 🔴 is provided by each 1 and 2 rolled. ⬛️ never provide 🟢 on a 6, exploding instead (see <a href="#exploding-dice">Exploding Dice</a>).</p>
    <p><i>Nicole assesses the results of her skill check. Her 🟩 result in two 6s, a 1, and three 4s, generating 2🟢 and 1🔴. Her ⬛️ result in a 3 and a 5, so no additional 🔴 are generated. The final assessment of her results says she succeeded in her Crafting(Cook) check and made a delicious meal! However, she did generate 🔴, which is credited to the GM as ⚠️.</i></p>
    <h3 id="capacity">Capacity and Depletion Rolls</h3>
    <p>If an item with a Capacity value is used for a skill check, a Depletion Roll must be performed after resolving the check. One Depletion Point is added to that item, then a number of ⬜️ are rolled equal to that item’s total Depletion Points. If the total value of all ⬜️ is equal to or greater than the item’s Capacity, the item has been spent and may no longer be used until refreshed. For weapons such as guns, that may mean they must be reloaded, while for consumable items such as medical supplies, it could mean they have been used up and more must be scavenged.</p>
    <p><i>Nicole is using some ingredients she foraged for her meal. Since she doesn’t have an unlimited supply of these ingredients, she needs to be careful not to use them all up. The day before, she had used some of her ingredients to make a meal over a warm campfire, and so had already added a Depletion Point to the ingredients (she has the ingredients recorded in her gear sheet as General Ingredients; some spices and other such consumables she doesn’t need to list explicitly). After resolving her skill check, she will need to add another Depletion Point to her ingredients, then roll 2⬜️. Her ⬜️ result in a 3 and a 2, for a total of 5. The Capacity on her ingredients is 12, so she hasn’t used them up yet.</i></p>
    <h3 id="exploding-dice">Exploding Dice</h3>
    <p>Some types of dice add more dice to the dice pool when rolled. This is called Exploding. Whenever an unmodified 6 is rolled on an exploding dice, another die of the same type is immediately rolled. Additional dice may explode further. Normally, only ⬛️, 🟥, and ⬜️ explode. No other types of dice explode unless explicitly instructed by an effect.</p>
    <h1 id="stress">Stress</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Stress (💢) allows a survivor to push themselves past their limits to survive. A survivor may take stress to force success during their skill checks, but they must be cautious. Overexerting oneself can lead to serious consequences.</p>
    <h3 id="forcing-successes">Forcing Successes</h3>
    <p>A failed check may be forced into a success through the use of stress. Any 🟩 result may be forced to a 6 if the survivor takes 💢 equal to the difference. For example, a survivor may force a 4 to a 6 by taking 2💢. A survivor may force a 6 even if doing so would cause them to exceed their Stress Threshold, though doing so is very dangerous (see Stress Threshold below). When forcing a success, a survivor must change their result to a 6. A 1 cannot be forced to a 2 to prevent a 🔴 for example, but would have to be forced to a 6, causing the survivor to suffer 5💢.</p>
    <p>Note that any 🟩 result may be forced to a 6, even if the skill check is already a success. This may be useful to generate more 🟢 or to mitigate generation of ⚠️.</p>
    <h3 id="overexertion">Overexertion</h3>
    <p>The maximum amount of 💢 a survivor can take before suffering consequences is determined by (Brains + Grit) x 2. This Stress Threshold may be increased by bonuses granted by gear, and may be decreased by negative statuses or other ailments.</p>
    <p>If a survivor's 💢 is greater than their threshold, they become overexerted. For each 💢 a survivor has above their threshold, they must roll an additional ⬛️ when performing a skill check of any kind. Remember, ⬛️ can never generate 🟢, but do explode, adding even more ⬛️ to the dice pool.</p>
