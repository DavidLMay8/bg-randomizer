            <p>The world is cruel, and the apocalypse is even worse. Suffering a slip or a scratch can spell death in a world where disease is rampant and the hospitals abandoned. Suffering damage is nearly impossible and is always dangerous. Survivors must traverse the land of the dead carefully.</p>
            <h2 id="defending">Defending Against Damage</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>A characterâ€™s defenses help prevent incoming damage, whether from an attack or from the hostile environment. All damage inflicted has a type, no matter the source. Attacks will always specify which type of damage is being dealt, while other types of damage are specified by the GM. For example, if a character fails a Prowess(Acrobatics) check while jumping from a fire escape, the GM may inflict bludgeoning damage due to the fall. A character with defense against bludgeoning would then be able to reduce or prevent some of that damage.</p>
            <p>All damage is presented to characters in the form of ðŸŸ¥, which are rolled to determine how much damage is suffered. This is referred to as a <b>damage pool</b>. All ðŸŸ¥ in a damage pool must be from the same damage type. If an attack would inflict more than one type of damage, a separate damage pool must be created for each type. Every attack specifies a number of ðŸŸ¥ to add to the damage pool, while the number of ðŸŸ¥ added for other sources of damage is decided by the GM.</p> 
            <p>After all ðŸŸ¥ have been rolled, the character defending against the damage may use abilities, items, or equipment to prevent some of that incoming damage. Defense prevents all damage from one or more ðŸŸ¥, removing them from a damage pool. Each of these dice is counted as being defended.</p>
            <h2 id="defense-forms">Forms of Defense</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Equipment, items, and abilities that defend against damage specify how many ðŸŸ¥ are removed from the damage pool, and whether the value of these ðŸŸ¥ must not exceed a specified number.
                <ul>
                    <li>ðŸŸ¥ - Defend a number of ðŸŸ¥ shown. Unless specified otherwise, these ðŸŸ¥ may be removed from any number of damage pools.</li>
                    <li>ðŸŸ¥ Type - Defend a number of ðŸŸ¥ shown against a damage pool of the specified damage type. <i>Example: ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¥ Bludgeoning defends two ðŸŸ¥ in a dice pool inflicting bludgeoning damage.</i></li>
                    <li>ðŸŸ¥(X) - Defend a number of ðŸŸ¥ shown which have a value equal to or less than X. Unless specified otherwise, these ðŸŸ¥ may be removed from any number of damage pools. <i>Example: ðŸŸ¥(3) defends one ðŸŸ¥ with a value of 3 or less, but cannot defend any ðŸŸ¥ with a value greater than 3.</i></li>
                    <li>ðŸŸ¥(X) Type - Defend a number of ðŸŸ¥ shown which have a value equal to or less than X from a damage pool of the specified damage type.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 id="damage-dice">Damage Allocations</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>When a character suffers damage, the value of each undefended ðŸŸ¥ (after any modifiers) is allocated to the character and recorded on their <a href="../mephitis-character-sheet.html">character sheet</a> under Damage Allocations.</p>
            <h2 id="aggravating">Aggravating Injuries</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>If the total value of all ðŸŸ¥ allocated to a character's Damage Allocations is greater than their Damage Threshold (DT), they must aggravate an injury by moving any number of ðŸŸ¥ from the character's Damage Allocations to an injury. Aggravating an injury may cause the character to suffer a new injury or may allocate additional ðŸŸ¥ to an existing injury. To determine the type of injury, use the damage type which caused the injury to be aggravated (Slashing damage would cause a Flesh Wound for instance). When aggravating an injury, enough ðŸŸ¥ must be moved from the survivor to the injury to reduce the allocation total on the survivor to less than or equal to their DT.</p>
