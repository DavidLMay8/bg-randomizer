            <p>Throughout their fight to survive the world of Mephitis, characters must face various encounters created by the GM. Encounters present difficult situations the characters must face and trials they must overcome. An encounter can take the form of a tense negotiation between a player character and an NPC, a daring feat of gymnastics across the rooftop of an apartment building, or a grisly fight against the infected. </p>

            <p>The GM may make an Encounter check as long as at least one of the following requirements are met:
            <ul>
                <li>Two hours have passed since the last encounter.</li>
                <li>Survivors enter a new location.</li>
                <li>Pay ⚠️10 - OL.</li>
                <li>It is deemed narratively feasible.</li>
                <li>Players spend too long deliberating.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>After the requirement for an Encounter check has been met, the GM will make an Encounter check with a dice pool of 6🟩. 1s do not generate 🔴, and the GM may force successes by spending ⚠ equal to the difference. An additional 🟢 per OL is generated.</p>
            <h2 id="survivor-response">Survivor Response</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>After the GM has finished the Encounter check, the survivors may make a Stealth save throw against it (see Save Throws below). The survivor with the lowest Stealth score must be the one to make the check as they pose the highest risk of getting the group caught, though because the entire group is involved in the check, the performing survivor still benefits from the additional 🟩 as the other survivors assist. Each 🟢 generated by the save throw reduces 🟢 generated by the Encounter check. If the Encounter is reduced to zero 🟢, it may be avoided entirely.</p>
            <p><b>Note:</b> The GM should always roll their dice behind a GM screen. They do not need to disclose the amount of 🟢 generated by the Encounter check before survivors respond. This can be useful if the GM still wishes to have the Encounter happen, even if the check is reduced to zero 🟢 (use discretion and don’t always overrule the players).</p>
            <h2 id="save-throws">Save Throws</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>A save throw is a special kind of skill check a survivor may perform in an attempt to mitigate negative effects. There are two types of save throws, <b>Compelled</b> and <b>Improvised</b>.</p>
            <p>A Compelled save throw is a free save throw which a survivor is instructed to perform. Many rules and abilities instruct a survivor to make a save throw, such as certain attacks or when an encounter is initiated by the GM. The result of the save throw is detailed by the effect that instructed the survivor to perform it.</p>
            <p>An Improvised save throw may be purchased by a survivor for 5🔶 in an effort to reduce incoming damage. A survivor may only purchase one improvised save throw per long rest. When using an improvised save throw to reduce damage, a survivor performs a Resolve skill check. Each 🟢 generated by the check prevents 1 point of damage.</p>
            <p>Note: Save throws never generate ⚠️, except when specified by the effects of a compelled save throw.</p>
