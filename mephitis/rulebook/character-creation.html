    <hr />
    <p><i>You never realize how much the mundane means to you until it's gone. The times where each day bleeds into the next? Those are special times. Those are the times to cherish, the days to long for. Those are the times that disappear in an instant. Every other dull ordinary day just goes poof, buh bye before you can blink your eyes. That's what happened when Mephitis came. One day we were all just living our boring lives. We were commuting, running errands, making dinner, watching the tv, and going to bed. Rinse and repeat. And then one day we were told to lock our doors, stay inside. Only a few days after that the world ended. Now we fight to make every day mean something. Now we live every day expecting it to be our last. God, we miss the good ol' boring days.</i></p>
    <h2 id="character">What Makes a Character?</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Mephitis is a tabletop roleplaying game set in an apocalyptic world overrun by the infected undead. A mysterious explosion at a military base unleashed a weaponized super virus into the air, which spread rapidly and infected most of the world. Now those few left alive fight to stay that way as the corpses of those infected relentlessly come shambling back to life, driven only by a mindless desire to spread the virus further.</p>
    <p>Your character in the world of Mephitis helps tell the story of the world and those who fight for it. Their decisions, experiences, conflicts, and pain shape who they are along with those around them. As a player, you have the opportunity to mold your character however you want. Will you play as yourself, simulating how you would survive the apocalypse? Will you create a character with a personality so polar opposite to your own that you have no choice but to leave your comfort zone? Your character gives you the foundation to tell a story when the world ends.</p>
