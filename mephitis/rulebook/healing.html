            <p>The world is cruel, and the apocalypse is even worse. Suffering a slip or a scratch can spell death in a world where disease is rampant and the hospitals abandoned. Suffering damage is nearly impossible and is always dangerous. Survivors must traverse the land of the dead carefully.</p>
            <h2 id="defending">Defending Against Damage</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>A characterâ€™s defenses help prevent incoming damage, whether from an attack or from the hostile environment. All damage inflicted has a type, no matter the source. Attacks will always specify which type of damage is being dealt, while other types of damage are specified by the GM. For example, if a character fails a Prowess(Acrobatics) check while jumping from a fire escape, the GM may inflict bludgeoning damage due to the fall. A character with defense against bludgeoning would then be able to reduce or prevent some of that damage.</p>
            <h2 id="damage-dice">Damage Allocations</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>When a character suffers damage, the value of each undefended ðŸŸ¥ (after any modifiers) is allocated to the character and recorded on their <a href="../mephitis-character-sheet.html">character sheet</a> under Damage Allocations</p>
            <h2 id="aggravating">Aggravating Injuries</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>If the total value of all ðŸŸ¥ allocated to a character's Damage Allocations is greater than their Damage Threshold (DT), they must aggravate an injury by moving any number of ðŸŸ¥ from the character's Damage Allocations to an injury. Aggravating an injury may cause the character to suffer a new injury or may allocate additional ðŸŸ¥ to an existing injury. To determine the type of injury, use the damage type which caused the injury to be aggravated (Slashing damage would cause a Flesh Wound for instance). When aggravating an injury, enough ðŸŸ¥ must be moved from the survivor to the injury to reduce the allocation total on the survivor to less than or equal to their DT.</p>
            <h2 id="attacking">Attacking</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>When attacking with a melee or ranged weapon, follow the structure below to resolve the attack.</p>
            <h3>Choose a target</h3>
            <p>Pick a target to attack within the attackâ€™s range. A weaponâ€™s profile specifies its range (see Weapons).</p>
            <h3>Make an attack check</h3>
            <p>Make a check for either Melee(Attack) or Ranged(Attack), depending on which weapon type is used for the attack. An attack check follows the same flow as any other skill check (see Skill Checks).</p>
            <h3>Roll damage dice</h3>
            <p>Every weapon has a base damage value. If the attack skill check is a success, gather a number of ðŸŸ¥ equal to the weaponâ€™s base damage. A weaponâ€™s profile also details any attack boosts it may have. Attack boosts may be triggered by spending extra ðŸŸ¢. The most common attack boosts add additional ðŸŸ¥, but some detail additional rules to follow. After applying any desired attack boosts, roll the final number of ðŸŸ¥ and apply modifiers.</p>
            <h3>Resolve defense</h3>
            <p>After all ðŸŸ¥ have been rolled and modifiers applied, the target defends against the attack. See <a href="damage.html#defending">Defending Against Damage.</a></p>
            <h3>Allocate damage dice</h3>
            <p>All undefended ðŸŸ¥ are allocated to the target and injuries are checked. For damage allocations against a player character, see Damage and Injuries for damage allocations to an enemy, see Damaging Enemies.</p>
