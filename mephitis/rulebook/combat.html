    <p>Surviving Mephitis means fighting for oneâ€™s life. A survivor may often come into contact with the infected or even with hostile members of the living. In such cases, combat might be unavoidable. Many encounters created by the GM revolve around combat and are called combat encounters. Combat encounters flow over a series of rounds until they reach a conclusion, usually a victory achieved when the survivors defeat their enemies. Each round represents only a few seconds of in-game time, with many encounters over within a minute.</p>
    <h2 id="initiative">The Initiative Roll</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>When combat begins, all participants (player survivors, NPCs, infected, etc.) roll for initiative. Each player makes a Prowess roll, applies any modifiers they may have, and lets the GM know their final result. The GM makes an initiative roll for each NPC involved in the combat, then takes the results of all players and all NPCs and lists them in order to determine initiative order during combat.</p>
    <h2 id="rounds">Combat Rounds</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Combat takes place over a series of rounds to completion. A combat round begins with the first participant in initiative order and ends with the last participant in initiative order.</p>
    <h2 id="turn">Combatant Turn</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>During their turn, a participant can move and take up to one of the following actions, in any order:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Attack</b> - See <a href="#attacking">Attacking.</a></li>
        <li><b>Dash</b> - The combatant may move again.</li>
        <li><b>Disengage</b> - Until the end of the round, the combatant's movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="attacking">Attacking</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>When attacking with a melee or ranged weapon, follow the structure below to resolve the attack.</p>
